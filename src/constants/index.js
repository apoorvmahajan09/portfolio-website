export const HERO_CONTENT = `I'm really into building cool web apps that work well and can handle a lot of users.

I want to use what I know to make new things that help businesses grow and make users happy.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I'm a dedicated web developer who loves making web apps that are easy to use and work really well. I've been doing this professionally for 5 years, and I've used lots of tools like React, Next.js, Node.js, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. I got into web development because I was really curious about how things work, and now I have a career where I'm always learning and tackling new challenges. I like working with others and solving tough problems to create great solutions. When I'm not coding, I stay active, check out new tech, and help out with open-source projects.`;
